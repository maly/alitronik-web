  * -40 to + 85 Â°C temperature range
  * maximum error of 1% accuracy
  * maximum offset 100 uV.
  * 12bit resolution
  * reduce the pressure drop on the shunt resistor
  * Calibration programmable registers can directly read its unit of measure is the ampere current, and power in watts per read.
  * For as many as 128 sampling averaging, in order to realize filter in noise environment.
  * The I2C interface has a timeout, not only can avoid the bus lock, but also can provide high-speed mode, meet the communication requirements of up to 3.4 MHz.
  * All features are support software programmable INA219.
  * Using single power supply, the working voltage between + 3.0 to + 5.5 V.
