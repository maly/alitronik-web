  * fully support of MACH3 and other computer software support for parallel port control.
  * USB power supply and peripherals powered phase separation to protect computer security.
  * peripheral wide voltage input, 12-24V, and anti-reverse function.
  * all of the input signal, all the light lotus isolated, which can be accessed emergency stop on the knife, the limit to protect computer security.
  * all the way to the relay output port, control spindle switch. Output port P17 mouth.
  * all the way through the optocoupler isolated 0-10V analog voltage output can be controlled with the corresponding analog interface converter to control the spindle speed. Output port P1 port.
  * open all 17 ports, which can be accessed with the optocoupler drive, 5-axis stepper motor can be controlled.
  * P1 as PWM outputs can be controlled with optocoupler input spindle governor.
  * can be accessed by a common cathode or common anode input level to 5V drive.
