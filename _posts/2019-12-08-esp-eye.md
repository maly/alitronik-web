[  
ESP32 + 2 megapixel camera + 4 MByte Flash + 8MByte PSRAM](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/tr2ADp08)

ESP-EYE is an ESP32-based development board that integrates a digital microphone, an 8 MB PSRAM and a 4 MB flash, while also providing an external 2-Megapixel camera. These features make the board ideal for applications relating to face detection, face recognition and speech recognition. Besides, the board can also support image transmission over Wi-Fi and debugging through a Micro USB port, which enables the development of advanced AI solutions.

# Face Detection and Recognition with ESP-EYE

This example demonstrates&nbsp;**Face Recognition**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Voice Wakeup**&nbsp;with ESP-EYE.

For hardware preparation, please see&nbsp;[HERE](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who/blob/master/docs/en/get-started/ESP-EYE_Getting_Started_Guide.md)

# [](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who/tree/master/examples/single_chip/recognition_solution#key-features)Key Features

- Voice wakeup
- Face detection
- Face recognition

## Software Development

ESP-EYE supports firmware downloading with a Linux, MacOS or Windows PC. At present, users must set up a toolchain in the development environment before starting software development.

### Preparation

- Go through&nbsp;<a>Get Started</a>&nbsp;to set up the toolchain in your PC.
- Connect the ESP-EYE to your PC with a Micro USB cable.
- Launch your development-environment tool, such as Terminal (Linux/MacOS) or MinGW (Windows).

### Getting ESP-WHO

To obtain a local copy, open your Terminal (such as Terminal in a Linux environment), go to the directory in which you want to store ESP-WHO, and clone the repository by using the&nbsp;git clone&nbsp;command:

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-who.git </pre>

ESP-WHO will be downloaded into an automatically-generated folder named&nbsp;esp-who.

Do not miss the&nbsp;&#8211;recursive&nbsp;option. If you have already cloned ESP-WHO without this option, please run another command to get all the submodules:&nbsp;git submodule update &#8211;init &#8211;recursive

### Setting up a Path to ESP-WHO

Please follow the instruction described in&nbsp;<a>Setup Path to ESP-IDF</a>&nbsp;to configure the&nbsp;IDF_PATH&nbsp;variable to&nbsp;esp-who/esp-idf.

### Downloading Firmware

This section describes the steps for downloading firmware to ESP-EYE (taking the Linux operating system as an example):

- Power up ESP-EYE by connecting it to your PC with a USB cable.
- Run&nbsp;ls /dev/ttyUSB\*&nbsp;in your Terminal to check if the board has connected itself to your PC successfully. If the connection is successful, you will see a newly generated item named e.g,&nbsp;/dev/ttyUSB0&nbsp;on your list, after running the command.
- Go to an example directory, such as&nbsp;cd esp-who/examples/single_chip/recognition_solution.
- Run&nbsp;make defconfig&nbsp;to complete the default configuration.
- Run&nbsp;make menuconfig&nbsp;and go to&nbsp;Serial flasher config&nbsp;->&nbsp;Default serial port&nbsp;to configure the device name, according to the name of the item you saw in the second step, e.g.&nbsp;/dev/ttyUSB0. Then, save it and exit.
- Run&nbsp;make flash&nbsp;to download the firmware.
