An electronic hourglass that uses an electronic circuit to control the light emitting diode indicates sand particles, simulating the movement of the hourglass. Electronic hourglass will be like a real hourglass, the upper part of the sand (light emitting diode) one grain a drop down, the lower part of the sand, one by one piled up. After the leak, the switch will be reset, and will start again, a grain of a downward leakage. This product adopts 1.6mm double PCB plate, circuit is composed of 57 5mm warm white LED hourglass pattern, under the control of the microcontroller program, presents the simulation hourglass effect, micro switch above can debug hourglass speed, while the number of light LED 28, can be used as a decorative light.
