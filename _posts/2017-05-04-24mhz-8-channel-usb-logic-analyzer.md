**Features:**

  * Logical channel sampling rates up to time of 24M/seconds. Application about 10M in General, sufficient to meet a variety of uses.
  * Logic 8 input-can be collected. signal analysis, sampling such as I2C,UART.
  * Logic can sample up to 10 billion, let you capture even the most elusive of the event.
  * Protection logic input resistors, overvoltage protection and buffer chips. Better protection of safety equipment.
