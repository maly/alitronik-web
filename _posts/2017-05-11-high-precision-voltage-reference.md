Onboard 15V battery, we know that the battery is the lowest noise so that it can output pristine, stable voltage to provide a reliable guarantee  
2. The board has four programming terminals ,each corresponding to an output voltage, short circuit by short-circuiting the corresponding terminal block to give the corresponding voltage. Because the AD584 programming pins in programming its short resistance will affect the output voltage, in order to reduce the short-circuit resistance, two terminals in parallel. Alternative switch terminal benefits are more reliable and flexible, short-circuit resistance can be smaller.  
3. Temperature coefficient: 5 ppm / °C (maximum, 0°C to 70°C, AD584L) 15 ppm / °C (maximum, -55°C to + 125°C, AD584T)  
4. Power consumption: Static current: 1 mA (max), low quiescent current is ideal for battery-powered.  
5. Load capacity: 10 mA  
6. Operating voltage: 4.5V to 30V, note that the required operating voltage higher than the programmed output voltage  
7. Temperature range: AD584J / K / L rated operating temperature range of 0°C to + 70°C, AD584S / T, with -55°C to + 125°C.  
8. The external power supply interface, you need more than 11V DC voltage  
9. The reference voltage output interface with copper 2mm test socket for easy card into the pen multimeter to measure or calibrate other instruments.  
10. Each board at the factory to be detected with Aglient 6 digit multimeter, and marked with the output voltage, user-friendly.  
11. Before detect multimeter and board warm-up at least 30 minutes at room temperature 25 degrees, to ensure that the detection accuracy.
