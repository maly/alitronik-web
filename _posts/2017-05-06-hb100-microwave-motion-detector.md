[Datasheet](https://www.limpkin.fr/public/HB100/HB100_Microwave_Sensor_Module_Datasheet.pdf)

HB100 usesÂ a microwave Doppler radar design principles of the microwave detector moving objects, mainly used in automatic door control switches, security systems, ATM automated video control systems, automatic train signal etc.

HB100 is the standard 10.525GHz microwave Doppler radar detector. The detection method compared with other detection methods have the following advantages: 1. non-contact detection; 2. independent of temperature, humidity, noise, air, dust, light other effects, suitable for harsh environments; 3. anti-RF interference ability; 4. the output power is small, constitute a hazard to humans; 5. distance: more than 20 meters detection range.
