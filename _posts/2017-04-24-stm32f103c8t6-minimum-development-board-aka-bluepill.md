<div>
  This is a devboard based on STM32F103C8T6 ARM, featured:
</div>

  1. the board based on the most basic MCU circuit, 8M and 32768 crystal circuit, USB power supply circuit.
  2. the core board is divided into two rows leads.
  3. SWD simulation debug download interface.
  4. MicroUSB interface.
  5. RTC crystal.

## ** Chip Description:**

  * Package Type: LQFP;
  * Number of pins: 48;
  * Kernel: Cortex-M3;
  * Operating frequency: 72MHz;
  * Storage resources: 64K Byte Flash, 20KByte SRAM;
  * Interface Resources: 2x SPI, 3x USART, 2x I2C, 1x CAN, 37x I / O ports,
  * Analog-to-digital conversion: 2x ADC (12-bit / 16-channel)
  * Timers: 3 general timers and 1 advanced timer
  * Debug Download: Support JTAG / SWD debug interface to download, support for IAP.

## ** Interface description:**

  * SWD interface: support for simulation, download and debug.
  * MicroUSB interface: power supply and USB communication, does not support the download.
  * USART1 interface: USART1 can be used to download the program, or use the USART1 for communication.
  * MCU pin interface: leads all I / O port pins, easy to connect with peripherals.
  * 5, 5V and 3.3V power input and output interface: commonly used in external power supply, or with other modules for common ground treatment** **

## Other Device Description:

  * Power LED (PWR): Power indicator status, can determine whether the power supply is stable.
  * the user LED (PC13): to facilitate the I / O output test or indicate the program running.
  * start jumping choose programming mode: (1, the user flash memory 2, SRAM 3, system memory).
  * reset button: reset chip for the user program.
  * 8M Crystal: The frequency can be set to make the system clocked at 72MHz.
  * 32.768KHz Crystal: Available for built-in RTC, or for calibration.
