Description:

  * Resistance measurement maximum resolution 0.01Ω. Can be measured up to 50MΩ.
  * Capacitor measuring range from 25pF-100mF, Resolution 1pF.
  * Larger than 90nF capacitor while measuring its equivalent series resistance (ESR), the equivalent series resistance of the highest resolution of 0.01Ω.
  * Larger than 5000pF capacitor also showed the rate of decline after the charging voltage of the capacitor value can reflect the quality factor (Q value).
  * Measuring a maximum of two diodes show its positive and negative, on-state voltage.
  * LEDs also display a graphic symbol diode, the conduction voltage is much higher than ordinary diode.
