There&#8217;s a big prototyping area, half of which is &#8216;breadboard&#8217; style and half of which is &#8216;perfboard&#8217; style so you can wire up DIP chips, sensors, and the like. Along the edges of the proto area, all the GPIO/I2C/SPI and power pins are broken out to 0.1&#8243; stips so you can easily connect to them. On the edges of the prototyping area, all of the breakout pins are also connected to labeled 2.5mm screw-terminal blocks. This makes it easy to semi-permanently wire in sensors, LEDs, etc. There&#8217;s also a 4-block terminal block broken out to 0.1&#8243; pads for general non-GPIO wiring. Finally, we had a little space remaining over the metal connectors so we put in an SOIC surface mount chip breakout area, for those chips that dont come in DIP format.
