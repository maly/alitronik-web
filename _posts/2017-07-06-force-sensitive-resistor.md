FSR can be seen as a resistor, through the size of the pressure to change its resistance, the resistance (in ohms per unit Ω) depends on how much repression.These sensors are fairly low cost and easy to use, but they rarely accurate.They sort is various, performance difference is only about 10%.So basically you use FSR, you should probably only expect to get a response range.Although the FSR can detect the weight, but choose their to get concrete data on the weight of is impossible.  
However, for most of the touch sensitive applications, such as &#8220;how much&#8221; this will be squeezed or push, they are a good choice, because of the high cost performance!

Parameter  
Size: thick (12.5 mm) in diameter, 1/2 &#8220;for the active field  
Resistance range: infinite/open (not pressure), 100 k Ω (light), 200 Ω (maximum pressure)  
Load range: 0 to 20 pounds (0 to 100 Newton), evenly smear on the surface area of 0.125 square meters  
Power supply: the use of less than 1mA current (depending on the ra/pull down resistor and the power supply voltage)
