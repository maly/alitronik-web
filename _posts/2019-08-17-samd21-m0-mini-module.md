The RobotDyn SAMD21 M0-Mini represents a powerful, 32-bit extension of the Arduino UNO platform, but to small size like Micro or Nano. The board is powered by Atmel&#8217;s SAMD21 MCU, featuring a 32-bit ARM Cortex® M0 core. Compatible with Arduino Zero and Arduino M0.

The SAMD21 M0-Mini board expands the family by providing increased performance, enabling a variety of project opportunities for devices, and acts as a great educational tool for learning about 32-bit application development. The Zero applications span from smart IoT devices, wearable technology, high-tech automation, to crazy robotics. The board is powered by Atmel&#8217;s SAMD21 MCU, which features a 32-bit ARM Cortex® M0+ core.

One of its most important features is Atmel&#8217;s Embedded Debugger (EDBG), which provides a full debug interface without the need for additional hardware, significantly increasing the ease-of-use for software debugging. EDBG also supports a virtual COM port that can be used for device and bootloader programming.
