  * Support six channels of data reception
  * low operating voltage: 1.9 ~ 3.6V low-voltage
  * 2Mbps, air transmission time is very short, greatly reducing the wireless transmission of collision phenomena (software settings 1Mbps or 2Mbps air transmission rate)
  * Multi-frequency points: 125 frequency points, to meet the multi-point communications and frequency hopping communications needs
  * Ultra-compact: built-in 2.4GHz antenna compact 15x29mm (including antenna)
  * Low power consumption: when in answer mode communication, fast air transmission and start-up time greatly reduces the current consumption.

Low application cost: NRF24L01 integrates all RF protocol high-speed signal processing section, such as: automatically resend lost packets and automatically generate an acknowledge signal, etc.

The SPI interface can take advantage of the microcontroller hardware SPI port or microcontroller I / O port to simulate the internal FIFO can be used with a variety of low-speed microprocessor interface, easy to use low-cost microcontroller.
